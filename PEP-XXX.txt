Abstract
========

This PEP proposes an extension of the indexing operation to support keyword
arguments.  Notations in the form a[K=3], or a[1:2, K=3, R=4] would become
legal syntax. In addition to a change in the parser, the index protocol
(__getitem__, __setitem__ and __delitem__) will also require adaptation. 

Motivation
==========

The current syntax of the indexing operation provides the following 
strategies for access 

   >>> a[3]       # returns the third element of a
   >>> a[1:10:2]  # slice notation (extract a subset of the data)
   >>> a[3,2]     # multiple indexes (for multidimensional arrays)

The additional notation proposed in this PEP would allow notations involving
keyword arguments in the indexing operation, e.g.

   >>> a[K=3]
   >>> a[3,R=3,K=4]

The following practical use cases for this notation present two broad categories
of usage of a keyworded specification in indexing: as an index, and as an option
contextual to the indexing:

1. In some domain, such as computational physics and chemistry, the use of a
notation such as Basis[Z=5] is a Domain Specific Language notation to represent 
a level of accuracy

  >>> low_accuracy_energy = computeEnergy(molecule, BasisSet[Z=3])

In this case, the index operation would return a basis set at the chosen level
of accuracy (represented by the parameter Z)

2. To provide a more communicative meaning to the index, preventing e.g. accidental
   inversion of indexes

  >>> gridValues[x=3, y=5, z=8]
  >>> rain[time=0:12, location=location]

3. A "default" option allows to specify a default return value when the index
   is not present

  >>> lst = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> value = lst[5, default=0]  # value is 0

4. For a sparse dataset, to specify an interpolation strategy 
   to infer a missing point from e.g. its surrounding data.

 >>> value = array[1, 3, interpolate=spline_interpolator]

5. A unit could be specified with the same mechanism

  >>> value = array[1, 3, unit="degrees"]

How the notation is interpreted is up to the implementing class. 

Current implementation
======================

Currently, the indexing operation is handled by methods __getitem__,
__setitem__ and __delitem__. These methods' signature accept one argument
for the index (with __setitem__ accepting an additional argument for the set
value). In the following, we will analyze __getitem__(self, idx) exclusively,
with the same considerations implied for the remaining two methods.

When an indexing operation is performed, __getitem__(self, idx) is called.
Traditionally, the full content between square brackets is turned into a single
object passed to argument idx:

    - When a single element is passed, e.g. a[2], idx will be 2.
    - When multiple elements are passed, they must be separated by commas: a[2,3].
      In this case, idx will be a tuple (2,3). With a[2,3,"hello",{}] 
      idx will be (2,3,"hello",{}).
    - A slicing notation e.g. a[2:10] will produce a slice object, or a tuple
      containing slice objects if multiple values were passed.

Except for its unique ability to handle slice notation, the indexing operation
has similarities to a plain method call: it acts like one when invoked with
only one element; If the number of elements is greater than one, the
idx argument behaves like a *args. 

However, an indexing operation has the strong semantic implication of
extraction of a subset out of a larger set, which is not present in a regular
method call, and its different visual style is important for readability.


Specifications
==============

The implementation should try to preserve the current signature for
__getitem__, or modify it in a backward-compatible way. We will present
different alternatives, keeping into account the possible cases that need
to be addressed

        C0. a[1]; a[1,2] (Traditional indexing)
	C1. a[Z=3] 
	C2. a[Z=3, R=4]
	C3. a[1, Z=3]
	C4. a[1, Z=3, R=4]
	C5. a[1, 2, Z=3]
	C6. a[1, 2, Z=3, R=4]
	C7. a[1, Z=3, 2, R=4]

The possible strategies for __getitem__ are:

Strategy 1: 
----------------------
In the current implementation, when many arguments are passed to __getitem__,
they are grouped in a tuple and this tuple is passed to __getitem__ as the 
single argument idx. This strategy keeps the current signature, but expands the
range of variability in type and contents of idx. 
We identify three possible sub-strategies P1, P2, and P3 as the product of the call. 
P1 uses a single dictionary for the keyword arguments. P2 uses individual single-item
dictionaries and P3 replaces the single-item dictionaries in P2 with a (key, value) tuple.

	C0: a[1]        -> idx = 1                    # integer
            a[1,2]      -> idx = (1,2)                # tuple

        C1: a[Z=3]      -> idx = {"Z": 3}             # P1/P2 dictionary with single key
                        or idx = (("Z", 3),)          # P3 tuple of tuples [*]
                        
        C2. a[Z=3, R=4] -> idx = {"Z": 3, "R": 4}     # P1 dictionary/ordereddict [**]
                        or idx = ({"Z": 3}, {"R": 4}) # P2 tuple of two single-key dict [***]
                        or idx = (("Z", 3), ("R", 4)) # P3 tuple of tuples [*]


[*] In this case, we use a tuple to represent key and value pair for the specific
     indexing entry. We need to have a tuple with a tuple in C1 because otherwise 
     we cannot differentiate a["Z", 3] from a[Z=3]
[**] Naturally maps to the traditional **kwargs behavior, however it breaks
    the convention that two or more entries for the index produce a tuple. 
[***] preserves the above behavior, and additionally preserves the order. 
     Preserving the order is also possible with an OrderedDict as drafted by PEP-468.

	C3. a[1, Z=3]   -> idx = (1, {"Z":3})     # P1/P2 tuple of two elements
	                or idx = (1, ("Z", 3))    # P3
	                
	C4. a[1, Z=3, R=4] -> idx = (1, {"Z":3, "R": 4})     
                           or idx = (1, {"Z": 3}, {"R": 4})
                           
        C5. a[1, 2, Z=3]   -> idx = (1, 2, {"Z": 3})
                           or idx = (1, 2, ("Z", 3))
                           
        C6. a[1, 2, Z=3, R=4] -> idx = (1, 2, {"Z":3, "R": 4})
                              or idx = (1, 2, {"Z": 3}, {"R": 4})
                              or idx = (1, 2, ("Z", 3), ("R", 4))
                              
	C7. a[1, Z=3, 2, R=4] -> idx = (1, 2, {"Z": 3, "R": 4})   # P1. Pack the keyword arguments. Ugly and unexpected.
                              or raise SyntaxError                # P1. Same behavior as in function calls.
		              or idx = (1, {"Z": 3}, 2, {"R": 4}) # P2
		              or idx = (1, ("Z", 3), 2, ("R", 4)) # P3

Pros: 
    + Signature is unchanged; 
    + P2/P3 can preserve ordering of keyword arguments as specified at indexing, 
    + P1 needs an ordereddict, but would destroy interposed ordering if allowed;
    + Stays within traditional types: tuples and dicts. Evt. OrderedDict;
    + Some proposed strategies are similar in behavior to a traditional function call;

Cons: 
    - Complex and wasteful; 
    - idx type and layout seems to change depending on the whims of the caller;
    - May be complex to parse what is passed;
    - P2 Creates a lot of single keys dictionary as members of a tuple. Looks ugly.
      P3 would be lighter and easier to use than the tuple of dicts, and still 
      preserves order (unlike the regular dict), but would result in clumsy 
      extraction of keywords.
    - Having a[1,k=2] map to y=(1,{"k":2}) makes it impossible to differentiate from
      a[1,{"k": 2}], which may or may not be indended. 


Strategy 2: kwargs argument
---------------------------

__getitem__ accepts an optional **kwargs argument which should be keyword only. 
idx also becomes optional to support a case where no non-keyword arguments are allowed.
The signature would then be either 

	__getitem__(self, idx) 
	__getitem__(self, idx, **kwargs), 
	__getitem__(self, **kwargs) 

Applied to our cases would produce:

        C0. a[1,2]            -> idx=(1,2); kwargs={}
	C1. a[Z=3]            -> idx=None ;  kwargs={"Z":3}
	C2. a[Z=3, R=4]       -> idx=None ;  kwargs={"Z":3, "R":4}
	C3. a[1, Z=3]         -> idx=1    ;  kwargs={"Z":3}
	C4. a[1, Z=3, R=4]    -> idx=1    ;  kwargs={"Z":3, "R":4} 
	C5. a[1, 2, Z=3]      -> idx=(1,2);  kwargs={"Z":3}
	C6. a[1, 2, Z=3, R=4] -> idx=(1,2);  kwargs={"Z":3, "R":4}
	C7. a[1, Z=3, 2, R=4] -> forbidden in agreement to function behavior

Empty indexing a[] of course remains invalid syntax.

Pros: Similar to function call, evolves naturally from it.
Cons: It doesn't preserve order, unless an OrderedDict is used.
      Forbids C7, but is it really needed?

Strategy 3: named tuple
-----------------------

Always return a namedtuple for idx instead of a tuple. 
Keyword arguments would obviousely have their key as key, and positional
argument would have an underscore followed by their order:

        C0. a[2]; a[2,3]      -> idx = 3; idx=(_1=2, _2=3)
	C1. a[Z=3]            -> idx = (Z=3)
	C2. a[Z=3, R=2]       -> idx = (Z=3, R=2)
	C3. a[1, Z=3]         -> idx = (_1=1, Z=3) 
	C4. a[1, Z=3, R=2]    -> idx = (_1=1, Z=3, R=2)
	C5. a[1, 2, Z=3]      -> idx = (_1=1, _2=2, Z=3)
	C6. a[1, 2, Z=3, R=4] -> (_1=1, _2=2, Z=3, R=4)
	C7. a[1, Z=3, 2, R=4] -> (_1=1, Z=3, _2=2, R=4) or
                                 (_1=1, Z=3, _3=2, R=4) or 
				 invalid ?

The required typename of the namedtuple could be "Index" or the name of the
argument in the function definition, it keeps the ordering and is easy to
analyse by using the _fields attribute. It is backward compatible, provided
that C0 with more than one entry now passes a namedtuple instead of a plain
tuple.  It should be faster than creating many one element dictionaries, too.

Pros: Looks really nice. namedtuple transparently replaces tuple and gracefully
      degrades to the old behavior.

Cons: According to some sources (Ref 3) namedtuple is not well developed.
      To include it as such important object would probably require rework
      and improvement;
      The namedtuple fields, and thus the type, will have to change according
      to the passed arguments. This can be a performance bottleneck, and makes
      it impossible to guarantee that two subsequent index accesses get the same
      Index class;
      the _n "magic" fields are a bit unusual, but ipython already uses them
      for result history.

Objections and Considerations
=============================

The first obvious objection to this PEP contents is that this extension
is not needed. One could keep the indexing as is, and use a traditional
get() method for those cases where basic indexing is not enough. This
is a good point, but as already reported in the introduction, methods have a
different semantic weight from indexing, and you can't use slices directly
in methods. Compare e.g. a[1:3, Z=2] with a.get(slice(1,3,None), Z=2).

Relative to Strategy 1, a comment from Ian Cordasco points out that "it would
be unreasonable for just one method to behave totally differently from the
standard behaviour in Python.  It would be confusing for only __getitem__ (and
ostensibly, __setitem__) to take keyword arguments but instead of turning them
into a dictionary, turn them into individual single-item dictionaries." We
agree with his point, however it must be pointed out that __getitem__ is
already special in some regards when it comes to passed arguments.

Introducing a "default" keyword would make dict.get() obsolete, which could be
replaced by d["key", default=3]. Chris Angelico however states: "Currently,
you need to write __getitem__ (which raises an exception on finding a problem)
plus something else, eg get(), which returns a default instead. By your
proposal, both branches would go inside __getitem__, which means they could
share code; but there still need to be two branches." 

Additionally, Chris continues: "There'll be an ad-hoc and fairly arbitrary
puddle of names (some will go "default=", others will say that's way too long
and go "def=", except that that's a keyword so they'll use "dflt=" or
something...), unless there's a strong force pushing people to one consistent
name.". This argument is valid but it's valid for any function call.

Finally, as part of the discussion of this PEP, it's important to decide if the
ordering information of the keyword arguments is important, and if indexes and keys
can be ordered in an arbitrary way (e.g. a[1,Z=3,2,R=4]). PEP-468 tries to
address the first point by proposing the use of an ordereddict.
